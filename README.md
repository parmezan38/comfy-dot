# Comfy Dot
Comfy Dot is an app for simpler and cleaner chatting experience. User accounts are generated and unchangeable, for a more private experience that is void of any personal information. Comfy Dot allows the user to create chat rooms with flexible user capacity limit. Chatting is fast and simple, using a character limit to ensure more streamlined messages.
Comfy Dot uses ASP.NET Core, IdentityServer, SignalR and Angular.  


## Getting Started

## Client

Navigate to src/Client and install dependencies:

```npm install```

To start the client server, run:

```ng serve```

## Server

Open the ComfyDot.sln project file with Visual Studio, and run with SelfHost or IIS Express.

Note: This app currently doesn't have HTTPS support out of the box, and isn't safe for production. You need to create your own SSL certificates and configure both client and server to use them to be able host on HTTPS.
